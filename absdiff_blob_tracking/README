Blob Tracking sample, using absolute difference.

* Screen shots

The black circle tracks a blob with the count of their occurances.
The blob is generated by the difference between current image and previous one.


* Requirements
- Camera
- Processing 1.0.6
  http://processing.org/
- Processing OpenCV Library
  http://ubaa.net/shared/processing/opencv/


* How to work
See the source code (absdiff_blob_tracking.pde).
In each draw, the program
  1. Gets current blobs using opencv.blobs().
  2. Compares the current blobs with the blobs in the blob history.
  3. Updates the blob history.

The core function depends on opencv.blob() function.
See below for more details about the function.
